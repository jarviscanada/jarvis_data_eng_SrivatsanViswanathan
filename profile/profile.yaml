summary: >
  Hi, my name is Srivatsan. I am a computer engineering graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University. I enjoy building software 
  applications to solve problems users have. One of my favourite projects I have worked on is Sweat Rewards. I developed a website 
  where users can see if they have won a prize draws they entered in and direct them to support resources. The previous website was 
  slow, difficult to search with, and not very mobile friendly. I decided to enhance user experience by creating a new website that 
  would solve all these problems. I also created a script that would insert all the winners from an excel file to the database which
  decreased manual labor. I'm looking for a software developer role where I can leverage my skills and experiences to contribute 
  to impactful projects and make a positive difference. I am willing to learn anything I do not know and have a strong desire to 
  continuously expand my knowledge and expertise.
