summary: >
  Hi, my name is Srivatsan. I am a computer engineering graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University. I enjoy building software 
  applications to solve problems users have. One of my favourite projects I have worked on is Sweat Rewards. I developed a website 
  where users can see if they have won a prize draws they entered in and direct them to support resources. The previous website was 
  slow, difficult to search with, and not very mobile friendly. I decided to enhance user experience by creating a new website that 
  would solve all these problems. I also created a script that would insert all the winners from an excel file to the database which
  decreased manual labor. I'm looking for a software developer role where I can leverage my skills and experiences to contribute 
  to impactful projects and make a positive difference. I am willing to learn anything I do not know and have a strong desire to 
  continuously expand my knowledge and expertise.

    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring App to record hardware specifications and monitor resource usages for each node in real time to help the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team manage their Linux cluster environment. The product is built using Linux bash scripts to collect the data, PostgreSQL to store the data, docker for hosting the database, and Git for version control. The application logs the hardware usage every minute and persists it into the database.
