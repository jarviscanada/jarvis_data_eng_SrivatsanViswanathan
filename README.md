# Srivatsan Viswanathan . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, my name is Srivatsan. I am a computer engineering graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University with a strong passion  for software development and DevOps practices. One of my favorite projects is Sweat Rewards, where I developed a website that  allows users to check their prize draw results and access support resources. I am now seeking a DevOps role where I can apply  my skills and experiences to contribute to impactful projects and make a positive difference.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SrivatsanViswanathan](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SrivatsanViswanathan)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SrivatsanViswanathan/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring App to record hardware specifications and monitor resource usages for each node in real time to help the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team manage their Linux cluster environment. The product is built using Linux bash scripts to collect the data, PostgreSQL to store the data, docker for hosting the database, and Git for version control. The application logs the hardware usage every minute and persists it into the database.

**RDBMS & SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SrivatsanViswanathan/tree/master/sql)]: Wrote queries to obtain information from a community centre. Accessed data related to various community operations like membership information, facility management, and booking management. The product is built using PostgreSQL to store the data and docker for hosting the database.


## Highlighted Projects
**Autonomous Ping Pong Collector**: Helped design and build an autonomous robot capable of navigating and collecting ping pong balls. Led the training of the robot to recognize and avoid obstacles, achieving a consistent confidence value of over 80%. Utilized PyTorch and Python to train an SSD MobileNet object detection model on a custom-labeled dataset, ensuring precise and reliable object detection.

**Sri's Pucks** [[GitHub](https://github.com/SrivatsanViswanathan/react-hockey-store)]: Created an ecommerce store enabling users to log in, browse, and purchase hockey equipment. Developed the front end using React, with state management handled by Redux for a maintainable codebase. Stored and managed product data on Airtable, and used Netlify Serverless Functions with Node to securely access API keys.

**Bookstore** [[GitHub](https://github.com/SrivatsanViswanathan/bookstore)]: Developed a bookstore application in Java, allowing clients to browse and purchase books while enabling owners to manage inventory. Implemented a loyalty program with classes that reward points for book purchases, enhancing customer engagement and retention.

**Job Tracker** [[GitHub](https://github.com/SrivatsanViswanathan/job-tracker)]: Developed a web application for job application management, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their job applications. Users can add, update, and delete job entries, and track the status of their applications. Built the front end with React, the back end with Node and Express.js, and used MongoDB for storing user credentials and job details.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2024-present)**: Developed software applications for Jarvis using technologies like  Bash, Git, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Worked collaboratively with a team of developers in an Agile environment. Implemented automation scripts, optimized PostgreSQL databases, and containerized applications with Docker for efficient deployment. Ensured code quality through peer reviews and continuous integration contributing to a culture of continuous improvement and high performance.

**Freelance, Sweatcoin (Jan 2024 - Apr 2024)**: Designed and created a web application that allows users to track their winnings for prize draws they have entered in. Utilized React for the front end, MongoDB to store the winners, and Node and Express.js for the backend. Created a script to persist all the winners from an excel file to MongoDB. Optimized the search functionality by reducing the search time by 92% and reduced website resource by 66%.


## Education
**Toronto Metropolitan University (2018-2023)**, Bachelor of Engineering, Computer Engineering


## Miscellaneous
- Volunteer: I volunteer at Parkrun on Saturdays at 9am to help run a 5km run. I've helped with various different tasks like scanning barcodes, recording times, photography, and helping the runners stay on course as a marshal.
- Running: I am training to run a 5k. I go on runs in the morning and am planning on running in Parkrun eventually.
- Hockey fan: GO LEAFS GO! I'm a big Leafs fan. I am hoping they are able to win a cup in my lifetime as they have not won since 1967...
